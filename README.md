> [!WARNING]  
> this visual novel contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen S2 (shibuya incident arc), simply for the death of a certain character. it's not huge spoiling, but i don't want people to be mad cuz i showed the face of their fav character dying or something...

## about
i had a huge idea where i thought i should make a game featuring jujutsu kaisen lore, and nobara with the hole in her eye (this traumatized me lowk), for a horror styled game. that's when i decided to build such a visual novel i guess?
<br>only issue is this has very low hackatime tracking cuz ren'py does literally all the work for you so i couldn't rly add much stuff
<br>but yeah, the game definitly has a "jumpscare" i guess...

## lore
the only lore in this visual novel that comes to explain the logic is the season 2 of jujutsu kaisen, it literally follows that logic. only thing that dosen't make sense is choso that dosen't kill jujutsu sorcerers.. but he's drunk, so that's all right.
<br>otherwise, yeah that's pretty much it

## keybinds
you can access the keybinds menu from the "Help" tab inside of the menu of the game (main menu, or escape). to recap, here are the most important keybinds:
* the mouse is used for selecting in menus and going thru the dialogue (left click)
* escape/right click opens up the game menu where you can save, etc
* V enables the TTS accesibility feature
* S takes a screenshot
* Shift+A opens up the accesibility suite
* CTRL skips dialogue while held down.

<br>overall, the controls are pretty much logic, and you should get there without too much difficulties. every command is accesible once again, from the help menu.

## installation, compatibility
the visual novel is avaialble on Linux, Windows and macOS via their official builds, aswell as an Android client (via an APK). You may also play the game thru the [web app](https://trickortreatnow.lolodotzip.tech), even tho it's rather slow and limited. it's really recommanded you install the game.

### install on computers
you may install the client for your desired operating system thru the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Lolo280374/trickortreatnow/releases), choosing the correct binary for your OS. the "all" zip file contains the game files for all compatible desktop operating systems.

### install on android
to install on android, you can also use the APK binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Lolo280374/trickortreatnow/releases), download it, and allow the installation. you will most likely run into a play protect warning, for the simple fact that no one has literally used this app, and i'm not gonna pay for play certifications. but this app is really not malware, but if you don't trust, use the web I guess.

## contributing
to contribute, you can simply git clone this repo, and then start editing the right .rpy file for the type of contribution you wish to do.
<br>the actual script of the visual novel is inside of the "script.rpy" file.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lolo280374/trickortreatnow.git
cd trickortreatnow
```
you may then request changes via a PR.

## credits
here are the list of stuff that truely helped this project, and without them yeah this wouldn't exist I guess:
* [Ren'Py](https://renpy.org) - the visual novel used for the whole execution of this project. this engine is so cool!
* [character.ai](https://character.ai/) - this might sound odd but character.ai was so useful for getting the voicelines (but i couldn't add them in the end, but it was useful)
* [the Jujutsu Kaisen Wiki](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/) - got most of the character images from them, very useful for up-to-date information
* [Gege Akutami (jjk's author)](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRDV0019R/jujutsu-kaisen) - getting screenshots of scenes, and houses (not all of them were from jjk) and obv for the lore
